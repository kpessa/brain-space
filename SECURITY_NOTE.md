# Security Note: API Keys

## Important: Your API keys were exposed in the chat

The API keys that were visible in the functions/.env file have been replaced with placeholders for security reasons.

### To restore functionality:

1. Create a new file `functions/.env.local` (this is gitignored)
2. Add your actual API keys:
   ```
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_actual_google_ai_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_key
   ```

3. **IMPORTANT**: You should regenerate these API keys since they were exposed:
   - [Regenerate Google AI API Key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - [Regenerate OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### Security Best Practices:
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use `.env.local` files for local development (gitignored)
- Use Firebase Secret Manager for production deployments
- Rotate API keys regularly
