# Testing Categorization in Gen Studio

## Setup Complete ✅

The categorization flows have been consolidated into a single production flow that:
- Uses the same schema as your Firebase Functions 
- Outputs Node-compatible format with proper field types
- Eliminates duplicate code and maintenance overhead

## How to Test in Gen Studio

### 1. Start Gen Studio
```bash
cd functions
pnpm run genkit:start
```
This will:
- Build the TypeScript files 
- Load environment variables from `.secret.local` or `.env.local`
- Launch Gen Studio at http://localhost:4000

### 2. Available Flows
You'll see these flows in Gen Studio:
- **categorizeThoughts** - Main production flow (same as used by Firebase Functions)
- **healthCheck** - Simple health check flow
- **contextAwareAnalysis** - Context-aware analysis flow

### 3. Test with Sample Data
Use this sample brain dump text:

```
I need to call the dentist tomorrow to schedule a cleaning
What if we implemented a dark mode for the app?
The login page is showing a 404 error when refreshing
How can I optimize the React Flow performance?
I realized that using memo() reduces unnecessary re-renders
TODO: Update the documentation for the new Node structure
```

### 4. Expected Output Format
The flow now outputs Node-compatible format:

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Tasks",
      "thoughts": [
        {
          "text": "I need to call the dentist tomorrow to schedule a cleaning",
          "title": "Call dentist",
          "type": "task",
          "confidence": 1,
          "urgency": 9,
          "importance": 7,
          "keywords": ["dentist", "call", "appointment"],
          "tags": ["health"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Key Features
- **Node-compatible fields**: `urgency`/`importance` as numbers (1-10)
- **Rich metadata**: `aliases`, `tags`, `keywords`, `reasoning`
- **Proper types**: All fields match your Node interface
- **Production parity**: Same flow as used by your Firebase Functions

## Changes Made
1. ✅ **Enhanced main schema** with Node-compatible fields
2. ✅ **Removed duplicate test flow** (`test-categorize-flow.ts`)
3. ✅ **Updated exports** in `genkit-flows.ts`
4. ✅ **Cleaned up package.json** scripts
5. ✅ **Verified compatibility** with existing Firebase Functions

Now Gen Studio will test exactly what your production system uses!
