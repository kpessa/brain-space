# Firebase Authentication in Production

## COOP Policy Warnings

You may see Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) warnings in the console when using Google authentication:
```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.closed call.
```

## What This Means

- **The warning is harmless** - Authentication still works correctly
- This happens because Firebase Auth popup tries to check if the window is closed
- Modern browsers with strict COOP policies block this cross-origin check
- Your authentication data shows everything is working (user is logged in)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Headers Configuration
We've set appropriate headers in Next.js config and middleware:
- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin-allow-popups`
- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: unsafe-none`

### 2. Production Redirect Flow
On Vercel deployments, the app automatically uses redirect flow instead of popup:
```typescript
const shouldUseRedirect = isProduction && window.location.hostname.includes('vercel.app')
```

### 3. Fallback Handling
The auth context includes fallback from popup to redirect if blocked:
- Tries popup first (better UX)
- Falls back to redirect if popup is blocked
- Handles redirect results on page load

## User Experience

1. **Development**: Uses popup flow (smoother experience)
2. **Production**: Uses redirect flow (avoids COOP issues)
3. **Both**: Authentication works correctly despite console warnings

## Firebase Configuration

Ensure your Firebase project has the correct authorized domains:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings
2. Add your Vercel domains:
   - `brain-space-lime.vercel.app`
   - `brain-space-*.vercel.app` (for preview deployments)
   - Your custom domain (if configured)

## Testing

Your test page shows authentication is working:
- User is logged in: ✅
- User data is stored: ✅
- Firestore access works: ✅

The COOP warnings are just browser security notices that don't affect functionality.
