# Google Auth Setup - WORKING! âœ…

## Issue Resolved
The "Database error saving new user" was caused by the auth trigger trying to create profile records. We've fixed this by updating the migration.

## Quick Test Steps
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/auth-diagnostic
2. Click "Clear All Auth" to start fresh
3. Click "Test Google OAuth"
4. Sign in with your Google account
5. You should be redirected back and see your session established

## What We Fixed
1. **Database Schema**: Updated migration to handle user creation properly
2. **Auth Callback**: Enhanced to show errors and handle OAuth response
3. **Supabase Client**: Configured with PKCE flow for better security
4. **Routes**: Added proper callback handling

## Your Setup
- Local Supabase: http://127.0.0.1:54321
- Google OAuth configured with your credentials
- Database schema ready for user profiles and progress tracking

## If Issues Persist
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Use the diagnostic tool at `/auth-diagnostic`
3. Ensure your Google Console has the correct redirect URIs:
   - http://127.0.0.1:54321/auth/v1/callback
   - http://localhost:54321/auth/v1/callback
